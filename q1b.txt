# If we list all natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 , the sum is 23
# Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
#Answer: 233168




#The function takes an integer as an input. All the multiples of 3 or 5 below that number is returned.
def SumOfMultiples(value):
	sum=0
	for j in range(3,value): #1 and 2 are not divisible by 3 or 5, hence start from 3
		if (j%3==0 or j%5==0): #If divisibe
			sum=sum+j #Add to sum
			
	return sum
	
	
print SumOfMultiples(1000)
